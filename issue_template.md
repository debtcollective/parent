Hi, Ann! Would something like this useful for people making events/actions?

Here you will describe the issue/feature you want to get fixed/implemented with as much detail as possible. This description should include at least:

* How to reproduce the problem. Include as many screenshots or videos you need to make it easier for the rest of team to understand what your thoughts are.
* How the designs will look (with links or attachments).
* In what environment the problem is happening (production, staging or development)
* An acceptance criteria (check below)

## Acceptance criteria

Acceptance criteria is a bullet list stating how the correct behavior of this ticket will look like, some examples are:

* When clicking the **Save** button, the UI should look with showing a spinner until the save completes.
* If the **Save** timeouts, we will show an error alert with the text **We couldn't save your record, please try again**.
