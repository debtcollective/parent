Right now, this is a placeholder repository which we only use for the issues: https://github.com/debtcollective/parent/issues

and the zenhub boards (you need the zenhub plugin): https://github.com/debtcollective/parent/issues#boards?repos=124314421

and some configurations shared across debt collective repositories.
