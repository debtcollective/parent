Right now, this is a placeholder repository which we only use for the issues: https://github.com/debtsyndicate/parent/issues

and the zenhub boards (you need the zenhub plugin): https://github.com/debtsyndicate/parent/issues#boards?repos=124314421

In the future, it would be cool if this contained configurations shared across debt syndicate repositories.
